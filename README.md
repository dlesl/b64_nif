[![Hex pm](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/b64_nif.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/b64_nif)

Erlang's `base64` module is implemented in Erlang and rather slow. This library
provides a very fast alternative using [aklomp's
base64](https://github.com/aklomp/base64).

There is another library, [b64fast](https://github.com/zuckschwerdt/b64fast),
which takes a similar approach. This library behaves slightly differently in that it:

* Validates input while decoding (raises `bagarg`)
* Uses dirty schedulers for large inputs rather than a streaming approach
* Only supports Base64
* Is even faster thanks to [base64](https://github.com/aklomp/base64) (on my machine at least)

Use
---

Add it to your `rebar.config`, for example `{deps, [{b64_nif, "0.1.4"}]}.`

Use `b64_nif:encode/1` and `b64_nif:decode/1` as drop-in replacements for
`base64:encode/1` and `base64:decode/1`.
